# THE MAIN CODES TO RUN ARE:

SGS_Geost_Strm_fun_filt_CHNL.m          ### SGS FLUXES FOR CHANNEL CONFIGURATION (See the code).
SGS_Geost_Strm_fun_filt_NEV.m           ### SGS	FLUXES FOR NEVERWORLD CONFIGURATION (See the code).
Spect_Calc_Mem_eff.m                    ### KE and EKE SPECTRA FOR CHANNEL &  NEVERWORLD CONFIGURATIONS (See the code).

# GRADIENT MODEL CODES:

The subroutines/functions for gradient model computations will be added when the work is published (more soon!)
