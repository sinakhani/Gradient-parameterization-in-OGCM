# Gradient-parameterization-in-OGCM

In this project, we introduce a new subgrid-scale parameterization for representing unresolved volume/eddy transports and momentum fluxes based on a Taylor series expansion of resolved varibales in ocean general circulation models (OGCM). An apriori study using high-resolution MOM6 outputs with 1/16 and 1/8 deg resolutions in channel and Neverworld bathymetry, is performed. Results of different ocean bathymetry and spatial resolutions, from eddy-permitting to non-eddying, are shown. Runnig setups for MOM6 simulations with different bathymetry are added. Also, Matlab codes for performing a priori spatial filtering are given.
